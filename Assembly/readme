Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment was pretty fun and helpful, I learned a lot about 
assembly. It was also cool to see how many optimizations could be made.

Was it fun?

Assignment was pretty fun. Learned a lot about assembly, feel very 
comfortable thinking in terms of the architecture of the computer,
optimziing to beat the compiler was very rewarding.

What is your mywc program test plan?

boundary tests:
mywc_empty.txt: empty text file, test lower bound

mywc_oneline.txt: 
contains a single new line, test lower bound

mywc_onespace.txt:
contains a single space, test lower bound

mywc_oneword.txt:
contains a single word w/ no spaces, test lower bound

mywc_max.txt: 
text file with maxed out characters & lines, test upperbound.
Modifyied generate to guarentee max lines + characters


statement tests:
mywc_statement1.txt: This file's characteristic is that it ends the 
first line with no space after the word and then a new line, and then 
the second line ends with a space after the word and no new line. This 
file covers all the lines of code except 52-53. 

mywc_statement2.txt: This file ends the first line with a space after 
the word and then a new line, and then ends the second line with no
space and no new line after the word. This file covers all code lines.

mywc_statement3.txt: This file has the same first two lines as 
statement2 except after the last word on line two, there is a new line.
Because there are no characters on that line, this file has the same 
line count as statement2. This file also covers all lines of the code.


stress test:
mywc_stress.txt: a randomly generated file with a random number of words 
and lines, but with a maximum number of characters

We wrote our own program generate.c to generate large files with random
characters.

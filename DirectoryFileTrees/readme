Student 1: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the
readme file, and edit it as appropriate.

Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I thought the first two parts of this assignment were challenging - it 
was frustrating at first to not be able to see the actual code. The last
part I thought was pretty fun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was fun. Learned how to use GDB, more rigorous background in testing.
Especially found parts 2 and 3 fun, enjoyed making checker by invariants
and a generic file system. 

Overall, my main criticism for this assignment are that I believe in part 
3,leaving option 1 as an option is misleading. No one should try to 
implement dir and files separately, and people will both learn more and
have an easier time with only option 2. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

ft.c: line 214: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
ft.c: line 348: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
ft.c: line 387: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
nodeFT.c: line 249: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
nodeFT.c: line 272: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

We do not want to validate pvContents or pvNewContents through an assert 
b/c we are allowed to insert NULL file contents.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

1. In Node_new in nodeDTGood, there is a comment above the function 
explaining what it does. This is unnecessary because the same comment 
already appears in the node header file.

2. In dtGood.c, the two if statements on lines 150 and 156 can be 
combined into one if(condition1 || condition2) statement because the two
blocks perform the same action.

3. In nodeDTGood.c, the static function Node_addChild is unnecessary. 
This is because it is only called once in the node file and all it does
is call DynArray_addAt. It does has a bunch of asserts, but at the point
in the Node_new functions, all those assertions have been proven true 
otherwise the prcoess would've ended already.
